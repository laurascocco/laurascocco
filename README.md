## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Laura, a Junior Data Analyst based in Venice, but always on the move, turning complex data into actionable insights.

While I haven't held a formal Data Analyst role, my journey has been filled with data-driven tasks. From managing financial data for international projects to enhancing AML systems at ING Bank and ensuring smooth logistics at B & C s.r.l., I've always worked with data to uncover trends and optimize processes.

These experiences ignited my passion for data, leading me to complete an intensive Data Analyst course. I've gained advanced skills in SQL, Python, and PowerBI, transforming my hands-on experience into technical expertise.

I hold a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Economics and Finance from Caâ€™ Foscari University, Venice, and a Google Data Analytics Certificate. I combine technical skills with strong communication abilities in Italian, English, and Spanish.

Outside of work, you'll find me volunteering, playing volleyball, or editing videos and photos. Let's connect!
